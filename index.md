### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite projects because it was my first time coding something. It was cool seeing my message print out. This project made me excited to start learning more in the class and coding in general.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorite projects because i was able to code a game on my own. It was fun being able to run the program and playing it with my friends. I feel like this lab helped me gain a general idea of how to code.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 one of my favorite projects because it was my first time coding some sort of image. I thought that it was interesting being able to display an image in the terminal from just writing a code. Although challenging, my partner and I were able to use critical thinking to print out the image on our own.
